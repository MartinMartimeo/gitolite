<h3>caveats and cautions</h3>

<p><a name="_important_notes_for_the_admin"></a></p>

<h4>important notes for the admin</h4>

<p>These are the things that can break if you use this ADC:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>if you, as the gitolite admin, are in the habit of force-pushing changes
to the admin repo instead of doing a <code>git pull</code> (or, even better, a <code>git
pull --rebase</code>) then you had better not enable this ADC.  Your users will
eventually come after you with pitchforks ;-)</p></li>
<li><p>there is no way to distinguish <code>foo/alice.pub</code> from <code>bar/alice.pub</code> using
this ADC.  You can distinguish <code>foo/alice.pub</code> from <code>bar/alice@home.pub</code>,
but that's not because of the foo and bar, it's because the two files have
different keyids (see later for what a keyid is).</p>

<p>So, if you have the same <em>filename</em> in different subdirectories of
<code>keydir</code>, you can't use this tool.</p></li>
<li><p>keys placed in specific folders (perhaps to do <a href="http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/doc/big-config.html#_optimising_the_authkeys_file">this</a>, or for
whatever other reasons), may not stay in those folders if this ADC is
used.  The only operation that is guaranteed to preserve specific key
placements like this is the "replace a key" operation (see "common
operations" section below).</p>

<p>If you're adding a brand new keyfile (typically with a new keyid, like
maybe <code>@home</code>), there is no way to specify where the key should go, so it
goes directly into <code>keydir/</code>.</p>

<p>More importantly, deleting a key that was in a specific folder, and then
undeleting it, will cause it to effectively move to the root of the key
store (i.e., the <code>keydir</code> directory in the gitolite-admin repo).</p></li>
</ul>

<h4>important notes for the user</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>discussion on how to tell your client to use the right keys is out of
scope of this document.  It's even more fun if you're overwriting key
files with new ones <em>and</em> are using ssh-agent!  Finally, if you're looking
to replace one of your keys, do not simply overwrite the keypair in your
<code>~/.ssh</code>.  You will need the old one in order to add the new one (see
below).</p></li>
<li><p>this is not a recovery program -- it will not help you if you <em>lost</em> all
your private keys.  You will need at least one keypair that is known to
gitolite in order to do anything at all with this script.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="_discussion"></a></p>

<h3>discussion</h3>

<p>This ADC lets users manage their own keys.  However, it works a little
differently to how users would do this in sites like github etc.  In those
cases there is a primary, web-based login using a password of some sort that
lets you do administrative tasks.  You acquire credentials for this using some
sort of sign-up process, possibly involving email.</p>

<p>Gitolite doesn't have any of that, since it's not meant to be a web-based
thing at all.  This has the following implications:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>your very first pubkey will still need to be sent to an admin the normal
way</p></li>
<li><p>you can then add, delete, or replace your keys, as long as one is always
"active".  You can even change that first key to something else, but at
all times you will need to have at least one valid key in the system,
because that is the only way gitolite recognises you.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="_terminology"></a></p>

<h3>terminology</h3>

<p>A pubkey can optionally have a <strong>keyid</strong>.  It can be empty, so the pubkey file
is named something like <code>alice.pub</code>, or it can have a value like <code>@home</code>,
making the pubkey file <code>alice@home.pub</code>.  If that's not clear, you MUST read
about how one user can have many keys <a href="http://sitaramc.github.com/gitolite/doc/3-faq-tips-etc.html#_one_user_many_keys">here</a>.</p>

<p>A keyid must start with the <code>@</code> character and after that contain only digits,
letters, or underscores.</p>

<p>An <strong>active</strong> key is one that is known to gitolite and works normally to give
you access to your repos.  If you never used this ADC (or your admin did not
even install it) then all your keys are active.</p>

<p>A <strong>marked</strong> key is one that has been marked for addition or deletion.  We use
what is arguably a kludge to mark keys: <code>alice.pub</code> is renamed to
<code>ZZZ-marked-for-del-alice.pub</code> <em>and</em> moved to the <code>ZZZ-marked</code> directory.
(The reason to use something like this is to ensure that marked keys can never
hide an active key, by appearing before it in the authkeys file).</p>

<p>A key <strong>marked for addition</strong> can be <strong>confirmed</strong> by running this ADC using
the key to be confirmed.  This is proof that you have the private key and
helps prevent a DOS by someone else.</p>

<p>The "add" can also be cancelled; see the <code>undo-add</code> command for details.</p>

<p>A key <strong>marked for deletion</strong> can be <strong>confirmed</strong> by running this ADC using
some other, <em>active</em>, key belonging to the same user.  This helps prevent a
user from locking themselves out.</p>

<p>The "del" can also be cancelled; see the <code>undo-del</code> command for details.</p>

<h3>common operations</h3>

<p><a name="_replace_a_key"></a></p>

<h4>replace a key</h4>

<p>Replacing a key is very simple.</p>

<ul>
<li>use the <code>list</code> command using any of your valid keys to reconfirm what keys
you have and which one you want to replace.  Note its keyid, if any.</li>
<li>using any of your active keys (even the one you want to replace is fine),
<code>add</code> a new key with the same keyid as the one you want to replace.</li>
<li>using the new (marked but not yet active) key, use the <code>confirm-add</code>
command</li>
</ul>

<p>This will replace the existing key with the keyid you specified.  It will also
preserve the directory placement of this existing key; in fact it is the only
command that will do so.</p>

<p>If you realised before you did the <code>confirm-add</code> that you did not want to do
this, you can use any active key to <code>undo-add</code> it.</p>

<p><a name="_delete_a_key"></a></p>

<h4>delete a key</h4>

<ul>
<li>use the list command as described in the "replace a key" section; make a
note of the keyid of the key you wish to delete</li>
<li>using any active key (even the one you wish to delete will do), run the
<code>del</code> command, giving it the correct keyid.  This key will now become
"marked for deletion".</li>
<li>using any active key, run the <code>confirm-del</code> command</li>
</ul>

<p>And if you goofed and marked your last active key for deletion, you can
<strong>undelete</strong> it using the <code>undo-del</code> command.  Just run it using the key that
was marked for deletion and it will undelete itself.</p>

<p><a name="_add_a_completely_new_key"></a></p>

<h4>add a completely new key</h4>

<ul>
<li>use the <code>list</code> command to look at your keyids and choose a new, unused one
for the key you are going to add</li>
<li>using any active key, <code>add</code> the new key, and don't forget to supply the
keyid!</li>
<li>using the new (marked but not yet active) key, use the <code>confirm-add</code>
command</li>
</ul>

<p><code>undo-add</code>, if needed, is done the same way as described above in the
"replace a key" section.</p>

<p><em>Warning</em>: if you omit the keyid, it will simply overwrite your normal key
(for example <code>alice.pub</code>).  <em>This is almost certainly not what you want if
you're reading this section!</em></p>

<p><a name="_commands"></a></p>

<h3>commands</h3>

<p><strong>NOTE on keyid</strong>: Except for the 'add' example below, I will show only one
variant of most commands (suffixed with the conventional notation for the
optional keyid).  Just <strong>remember</strong> that if the keyid is empty, the keyfile
name used is <code>alice.pub</code>, while if it is, for instance <code>@home</code>, then
<code>alice@home.pub</code> is the keyfile name.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>list</strong>: listing your current keys can be done from any key (active or
marked).  It is a very useful command and since it also prints
fingerprints you can use it to be absolutely sure which of your keys is
where on the server (<code>ssh-keygen -l -f something.pub</code> will give you the
fingerprint of that pubkey file).</p>

<pre><code>ssh git@server sskm list
</code></pre>

<p>Sample output:</p>

<pre><code>hello alice, you are currently using a normal ("active") key
you have the following keys:
== active keys ==
1: e9:b8:e9:6c:5e:c5:51:19:75:98:31:39:44:50:47:d2 : alice.pub
== keys marked for addition/replacement ==
1: f0:16:b8:b0:82:90:1d:29:dc:14:04:14:a5:58:f2:c7 : alice.pub
== keys marked for deletion ==
1: d3:09:15:10:96:bc:eb:a2:ae:a7:dd:46:62:d1:6b:1f : alice@home.pub
2: 14:82:fb:b4:89:24:5d:26:c8:32:65:d0:0e:d9:99:16 : alice@work.pub
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>add</strong>: adding a new key can only be done from an active key</p>

<pre><code># without using any keyid (normal key):
cat alice-new.pub | ssh git@server sskm add

# or, using a keyid of @home here:
cat alice-new@home.pub | ssh git@server sskm add @home
</code></pre>

<p>When you later run the 'confirm-add' command, the new keyfile will either
replace any existing keyfile of the same name or create a new one in
<code>keydir/</code> if none existed before.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>confirm-add</strong>: confirming a 'marked for add' key can only be done by
using the candidate key itself to authenticate</p>

<pre><code>ssh -i ~/.ssh/alice-new git@server sskm confirm-add [@keyid]
</code></pre>

<p>Once this is done you can work on your <code>~/.ssh</code> to delete the old keys.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>undo-add</strong>: undoing a mistaken "add" operation also requires an active
key as well</p>

<pre><code>ssh git@server sskm undo-add [@keyid]
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>del</strong>: deleting an existing key requires an active key.  It's also good
to run the 'list' command to refresh your memory of what keys you have and
which one you want to delete</p>

<pre><code>ssh git@server sskm del [@keyid]
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>confirm-del</strong>: confirming the deletion requires an active key.  This
prevents inadvertent self-lockout</p>

<pre><code>ssh git@server sskm confirm-del [@keyid]
</code></pre></li>
<li><p><strong>undo-del</strong>: undoing a del, just like confirming an "add", needs to be
done by using the candidate key itself</p>

<pre><code>ssh git@server sskm undo-del [@keyid]
</code></pre></li>
</ul>
